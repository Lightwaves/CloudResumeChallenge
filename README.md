# CloudResumeChallenge


Currently a work in progress

On my roadmap is a fully functioning frontend and backend with Behavior Driven Tests and Regression Tests including Database Data Mocking, End to End smoke test executed through
CI/CD, I plan to make the project my own by deviating a bit from the standard project by using a .Net Core Stack With a Postgres Database running on Lambda and Managed RDS. Once I finish the original challenge I may also create an additional admin panel which will show the number of users per month in addition to a total and place this behind an authenticated page which uses AWS Cognito as an Identity provider.

I received my AWS Cloud Practitioner before starting the project.
